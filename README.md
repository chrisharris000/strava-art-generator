# Strava Art Generator
 
## Background
> Strava Art is made using your GPS computer to create a picture of your activity whether it's cycling, running, swimming, walking, hiking, skiing... anything really! Your activity is then synced with strava.com to reveal your artwork!

I have been making Strava Art for a while now, but finding art in the streets can sometimes difficult. The aim of this project is to develop a way to find a provided image in selected area.

## Examples
There are plenty of examples on [strav.art](https://www.strav.art/), including some of my own:
